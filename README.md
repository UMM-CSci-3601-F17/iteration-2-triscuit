## Setup

As in the labs, you'll be using IntelliJ. Once you've all joined your
group using GitHub classroom, you can clone your repository using IntelliJ:

- When prompted to create a new IntelliJ project, select **yes**.
- Select **import project from existing model** and select **Gradle.**
  - Make sure **Use default Gradle wrapper** is selected.
- Click **Finish.**
- If IDEA asks you if you want to compile JavaScript to TypeScript :fire: DO NOT :fire:
it will break your project.

:warning: IDEA will sometimes decide to "help" you by offering
"Compile TypeScript to JavaScript?" :bangbang: *Never* say "OK" to this
offer -- if you do it will make a complete mess of your project. We're
using other tools (`gradle`, `ng`, and a thing called `webpack` which you
never explicitly see) to do that compilation. If you let IDEA do it, you'll
have a ton of JavaScript files cluttering up your project and confusing other
tools.

## Running your project

- The familiar **run** Gradle task will still run your SparkJava server.
(which is available at ``localhost:4567``)
- The **build** task will still _build_ the entire project (but not run it)
- The **runClient** task will build and run the client side of your project (available at ``localhost:9000``)
- The **build.sh** is a script that calls upon gradle build to build the entire project which creates an executable to be able to launch the
project in production mode. To run **build.sh**, go to your project directory in a terminal and enter:``./build ``

When **build.sh** is run the script **.sage_run.sh** is copied to ~/**sage.sh** that when launched i.e. ``./sage.sh``
will run your project in production mode. The API_URL within the _environment.prod.ts_ should reflect the url to get to your server e.g. 
``http://localhost:4567`` or ``http://acooldomainname.com``

:exclamation: Pro-tip: IntelliJ comes with a nice view to see the mongo databases setup.
To access this click on File -> Settings -> Plugins, type Mongo and make sure the Mongo Plugin is installed.
Now head to View -> Tool Windows -> Mongo Explorer. Then use the tool icon to add configuration.
Once prompted type for Path to Mongo Shell: _"/usr/bin/mongo"_
and hit the <span style="color:green">green :heavy_plus_sign:</span>, to add your label and, huzzah!, Mongo Explorer is on your side bar.

## Testing and Continuous Integration

Testing options are still integrated in this lab so you can test the client, or the server or both.
Testing client:
* `runAllTests` runs both the server tests and the clients tests once.
* `runClientTests` runs the client tests once.
* `runClientTestsAndWatch` runs the client tests every time that the code changes after a save.
* `runClientTestsWithCoverage` runs the client tests and deposits code coverage statistics into a new directory within `client` called `coverage`. In there you will find an `index.html`. Right click on `index.html` and select `Open in Browser` with your browser of choice. For Chrome users, you can drag and drop index.html onto chrome and it will open it.  
* `runE2ETest` runs end to end test for the client side. NOTE: Two Gradle tasks _must_ be run before you can run the e2e tests. 
The server (`run`) needs to be on for this test to work, and you have to
need to have data in the `dev` database before running the e2e tests!
* runServerTests runs the server tests.

Turn on your repo in [Travis CI][travis], replace the build status image in this README, and push your changes. That will trigger a build with Travis.
